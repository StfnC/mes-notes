My second  webapp, a website where you can plot your marks and visualize them on a chart.
I also made a section about the R Score, where you can learn how it is calculated and you can
play around with the different parameters to get a feel of what they do and how they impact the R Score.

I built this website for a school project, we were free to do wathever we wanted and I decided to create a webapp
to learn new concepts and challenge myself.
